![Research Threats. Legal Threats Against Good Faith Security Researchers. Disclose.io](goodies/header-image.png?raw=true "Research Threats. Legal Threats Against Good Faith Security Researchers. Disclose.io")

Includes many historical legal events copied with permission from [@attritionorg](https://github.com/attritionorg), originally at [https://attrition.org/errata/legal_threats/](https://attrition.org/errata/legal_threats/), which is still maintained. Crowd-sourcing this data through this repository is strongly recommended by all parties.

It doesn't matter that just about every company and product ships with vulnerabilities; security should be built into a product, rather than applied as a band-aid solution. Secure products are better, and a responsive security team should be an integral part of the development life cycle of that product. Vulnerabilities will happen; the response to those reports are what is important. Burning bridges and dismissing the good will of researchers offering to help secure your products does not benefit anyone.

## For Companies

Find examples below of **what *not* to do**.

Embrace security researchers. Learn from the documented examples in this archive. Researcher's who have been threatened by naive entities while legitimately working to improve the security of a product should be a source of collaboration; they may know more about your systems than you do. Put researchers who voluntarily submit bugs & vulnerabilities in touch with your internal security teams, work together to fix vulnerabilities, and coordinate the disclosure to your customers and the public.

- An **excellent coordinated disclosure** generally **boosts a company's public image** & customer confidence. It encourages researchers to work with you, not against you.

- A **negative experience** can exponentially generate **negative publicity, [sometimes even viral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)**.

- Providing researchers **safe harbor for reporting a vulnerability** to you is critical to working towards a **more secure product and ecosystem**.

Entities that engage researchers and respond quickly to security events are more likely to generate a positive experience.

Entities with no security response team, may be more likely to experience a negative disclosure event.

## For Researchers

Find examples below of **what *can* happen when things go wrong**.

Shield yourself from threats by always acting in good faith, following a company's vulnerability disclosure terms and visit the [EFF's Coders' Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders). Work with companies and respect their timelines for implementing fixes. What may seem like an "easy fix" to you may be more complicated for a vendor maintaining multiple code trees across hundreds of platforms supporting thousands of customers.

Companies fear negative publicity; but companies also ship bugs & vulnerabilities out into the wild. Any publicity that may challenge the security aspect of a product may lead to legal threats or calls to law enforcement.

Engaging a company with an extensive, well managed security vulnerability program, will almost never lead to legal action. In fact, you may even be protected from violating a license agreement, while conducting good faith research, under safe habor.

Engaging a company that favors profit over ethics, or considers protecting the bottom line as more important than doing the right thing, may lead to challenges. Some companies welcome vulnerability reports. Some companies don't, but that does not make them immune from exploitation.

### Confirmed Threats Made Against Researchers

| **When** | **Entity** | **Researcher(s)** | **Topic** | **Status** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-29 | [City of Columbus, Ohio]() | [Connor Goodwolf](https://linktr.ee/connorgoodwolf) | City gets hacked and sues researcher for investigating the Dark Web data. | On July 18 2024, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther's office released a statement saying the city's department of technology "found evidence of an abnormality in its system on July 18." Various city services were taken offline. Rhysida ransomware group demanded nearly $2M ransom for 6.5TB of stolen city data. Two class-action lawsuits were launched against the city for failing to adopt sufficient security practices. As usual, the city responded by telling its residents to enroll in Experian, which involves entering additional personal information online. An innocent security researcher, Connor Goodwolf, a resident of the city at the time, informed local news station 10tv the extent of the breach and what information was available in the hacked data. The data allegedly contained driver license information from City Hall, prosecution data including victims, suspects or recipients of subpoenas. Connor, who was helpful in informing people if they were be affected by the city-wide breach, received a restraining order, preventing Connor from discussing further what Rhysida ransomware group had stolen. [View Story](https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/city-columbus-sues-cybersecurity-expert/530-fc59233d-39cb-463f-9454-0234f1c8cced). In the judge's restraining order against the security researcher, who was merely reporting on the stolen data, the city was seeking $25,000 in damages, with the total amount determined at trial. Instead of taking the Rhysida ransomware group (the bad guys), the city responded by requesting a restraining order and court proceeedings against the security researcher (the good guy). The city filed four claims of relief against the security researcher: Damages for criminal acts, Invasion of privacy, Negligence, Civil conversion. Franklin County Common Pleas Court records show a final pretrial conference is scheduled for Sept. 18, 2025. |
| 2024-01-18 | [Modern Solution GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.modernsolution.net/) | Unnamed security researcher | Researcher reports vulnerability, vendor denies it, researcher ends up being sentenced by a court. | A programmer who analyzed software for a customer and discovered a security vulnerability was later sentenced to a fine of 3,000 euros for unauthorized access to third-party computer systems and spying on data. Modern Solution GmbH & Co. KG connected stock management with online marketplaces in Germany, and the software involved inventory, product and customer tracking data. The identity of the researcher is not available, but heise.de claims they [know the identity of the researcher](https://www.heise.de/news/Datenleck-bei-Modern-Solution-Hausdurchsuchung-statt-Bug-Bounty-6222165.html). With the assistance of an e-commerce blogger, Mark Steier, the researcher reported the vulnerability to the company (Modern Solution). According to Heise.de, "Modern Solution denied that there was a vulnerability." Subsequently, Modern Solution took the vulnerable service offline and the [researcher made their report public](https://wortfilter.de/warnung-datenleck-beim-jtl-partner-modern-solution-gmbh-co-kg/). In the post released June 23, 2021, it shows a connection being made to a database, on the domain ModernSolution.net, and customer data was accessible with screenshot proofs provided in the post. Given the complex GDPR environment in the European Union and threat of massive crippling fines for accidental data breaches, it is now seemingly more common to see researchers in the crosshairs of companies trying to blame their breaches on the good guy. On September 15, 2021, [a search squad from Criminal Investigation Department 22](https://www.heise.de/news/Datenleck-bei-Modern-Solution-Hausdurchsuchung-statt-Bug-Bounty-6222165.html) of the Aachen police showed up at the researcher's door. According to the researcher's account, the officers posed as parcel carriers, gained access to the apartment and pushed him against the wall. The police confiscated a PC, five laptops, a mobile phone and five external storage media - all of the programmer's work equipment. Modern Solution even published a data breach notification, [as seen in this PDF](https://wortfilter.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/moso-1.pdf). In June 9 2023, the [case was actually rejected](https://www.heise.de/news/Modern-Solution-Anklage-gegen-Aufdecker-von-Sicherheitsluecke-gescheitert-9182813.html) because Modern Solution had failed to protect the password. It took nearly one and a half years for the researcher to get their computer and hard drives back. This is a perfect example of how a good faith researcher attempted to do the right thing, and was later brought before a judge and fined 3,000 euros. In the breach notice itself, Modern Solution calls the researcher an 'ethical hacker'. In court, however, the public prosecutor spent a significant portion of time alleging that the defendant had decompiled the program code of Modern Solution's software in order to obtain the password for the database connection. The defendant stated that he had simply looked at the file in question (MSConnect.exe) with a text editor and had thus read out the database password in plain text. |
| 2023-12-27 | [NEWAG](https://www.newag.pl/en/) | [Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych (SPS)](https://serwispojazdowszynowych.pl/), [Dragon Sector CTF](https://dragonsector.pl/) | Security Researchers find disturbing DRM on trains, get sued. | A country-wide scandal erupted in Poland between 2023 and 2024, as train manufacturer Newag was found to have added bizarre DRM-style features to prevent its vehicles from being repaired at unauthorized geographical areas. This included at least one instance on November 21, 2023 of a train being bricked. SPS Mieczkowski (a train service company) failed to repair one of Newag's trains, and took matters into their own hands hiring security researchers from Dragon Sector CTF to get more information. One of the researchers, Michał Kowalczyk, "discovered the manufacturer’s interference in the software, which led to forced failures." On 27th December, 2023, three of the resaerchers [published some of their findings during a talk](https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-12142-breaking_drm_in_polish_trains#t=3269) at CCC. Various arbitrary software locks and "geofencing" locks were described by the researchers, that were designed to deter competitors from working on the trains. In a statement from Newag, "We have not, do not, and will not introduce into the software of our trains any solutions that lead to intentional failures. This is slander from our competition, which is conducting an illegal campaign of black PR against us," the [statement read](https://www.railway-technology.com/news/the-story-of-the-great-polish-train-hack/?cf-view). Newag alleged that Poland’s Lower Silesian Railways (LSR) was "attempting to avoid having to pay contractual penalties of as much as $500,000 for not completing the agreed routes and services". A whirlwind of accusations and deflections continued over 2024, including Newag claiming that the software locks aren't real, and is driven by a PR campaign to avoid paying, tank their stock price, and other political reasons. Although Dragon Sector was not sued, [they were apparently threatened by Newag](https://www.404media.co/polish-hackers-repaired-trains-the-manufacturer-artificially-bricked-now-the-train-company-is-threatening-them/), however, "because of the evidence gathered during their analysis, the Dragon Sector team has doubts about whether Newag will actually follow through with the lawsuit." [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/manufacturer-deliberately-bricked-trains-repaired-by-competitors-hackers-find/) |
| 2023-07-23 | [Ford](https://www.ford.com/) @ford, [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/) @rapid7 | [Ben Sadeghipour](https://x.com/nahamsec/) | Rapid7 asks NahamSec to take down a video about Ford. | On August 23, 2023, Ben Sadeghipour (nahamsec) [tweeted](https://x.com/nahamsec/status/1694388639994675568) that he had received an email from Rapid7 about one of his YouTube videos. Rapid7 claimed that nahamsec was "operating illegally" and is "active in aiding criminals in their fradulent activities". @Rapid7 was acting on behalf of @Ford, as part of Rapid7's effort to allegedly, "neutralize active cyber threats that endanger their brand, customers and employees." In a twitter reply, nahamsec stated that he replied to the email, "I told them I have done nothing wrong and that if they want it gone they'll have to wait a bit." |
| 2023-07-16 | [Arm Ltd](https://www.arm.com/) | [Maria Markstedter "Azeria"](https://x.com/Fox0x01) | Arm submits abuse report to researcher's domains about IP. | On August 16, 2023, Maria Markstedter [received an abuse report](https://x.com/Fox0x01/status/1691774253014618222/) about one of her domains, arm-assembly.com related to copyright infringement. Arm, a computer architecture, and Arm Ltd., a company about to go public at the time, through the abuse report states that Maria was unauthorized in using the domain name arm-assembly.com.  Arm had known about Maria's domains for years, and suddenly decided to take her domains by IP force. In an [interview with The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/31/a_star_star_domains/), Maria stated that she wrote her thesis about Arm security and exploit mitigations for Arm and that she had previously given internal talks at the company. Another Cease & Desist came which included all of Maria's other related domains  arm-reversing.com, arm-exploitation.com, arm-basics.de, and azeria-labs.com and all were taken down by the registrar. She eventually transferred the domains with the word "arm" to Arm, and Maria changed her domain to leg-assembly.com. This incident is another example of great research being shut down by an IP holder, with which the researcher had an ongoing legacy relationship with. The chilling effect of this is that Azeria, who is a leading Arm researcher, was punished by the brand, and it deters other researchers from researching and sharing knowledge of brands, like Arm. |
| 2023-04-12 | [FreeHour](https://www.freehour.eu/) | Giorgio Grigolo, Michael Debono, Luke Bjorn Scerri and Luke Collins | Students arrested, stripped naked, violated by Police. | On October 18, four computer-science students emailed [FreeHour](https://www.freehour.eu/) about software vulnerabilities in their student timetabling app, with a hefty 90 day disclosure window. Alongside their responsible disclosure to [FreeHour](https://www.freehour.eu/), the students asked if their good-faith advisory would be eligible for a possible bounty, once the bug had been patched. One or more imbeciles at [FreeHour](https://www.freehour.eu/) lied to the Police about the nature of the student activity. [Scerri, Grigolo and Debono received serach warrants, all their homes were raided by the Police](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/we-wanted-help-students-arrested-exposing-freehour-security-flaw.1024757), and instead of receiving a bug bounty reward, they were heinously strip searched, had their computers violated as a result of the inadequeate response by FreeHour. Originally, the authorities told them that their items would be returned within several weeks but they are currently still having their right violated. Collins was in England studying for his PhD, yet was questioned when he returned to the country for Christmas. [FreeHour](https://www.freehour.eu/) founder and CEO [Zach Ciappara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-ciappara/) said that, once he received the e-mail from the four students in October, he contacted the office of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC) and the Cyber Crime Unit for advice. After the situation began to escalate for FreeHour, the CEO subsequently [published a statement on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq712wtITdm/). According to another statement, "Due to the mention of payment, changes to the app’s front end & a 90 day ultimatum, FreeHour was legally advised to report this to the Police as a potential threat. [The company is starting to do cyber now](https://www.freehour.eu/post/what-freehour-is-doing-after-learning-what-happened-to-the-4-students), and is apparently committed to doing so on an ongoing basis. "We are also willing to work with the four students to assist in improved security, and to implement new measures. Moreover, we are undergoing internal training in INFOSEC, GDPR and data integrity," CEO Zach Ciappara added. It is unclear whether the students would be willing to work with the company again, given they were stip searched, raided, violated, and arrested. |
| 2022-02-12 | [Cole County Prosecuting Attorney @ The State of Missouri](https://colecounty.org/430/Attorneys) | [Josh Renaud](https://twitter.com/Kirkman) - [View Statement](https://joshrenaud.com/pd/josh-renaud-personal-statement.pdf) | Prosecutor Drops Charges After Four "Anxious" Months | On February 11th, the public received a statement from [Josh Renaud](https://twitter.com/Kirkman), who was previously unnamed in the incident below, dated 2021-10-15 involving [The State of Missouri](https://www.mo.gov/) & [St. Louis Post-Dispatch](https://www.stltoday.com/). In [Renaud's statement](goodies/josh-renaud-personal-statement.pdf), Renaud was accused on television as a malicious "hacker". [In his statement](goodies/josh-renaud-personal-statement.pdf), Renaud details the significant harm caused by this investigation, which is, "entirely legal and consistent with established journalistic principles." It is also the only way to report bugs: to the vendor, of course. Renaud's statement details that this, "has been one of the most difficult seasons of [his] nearly 20-year career in journalism. But [he had] found strength in the prayers and support of my family and friends and so many others across the country." This entry has been entered as a separate update as Renaud was previously unnamed. The statement speaks for itself and should be a wake up call to those who persecute others for political gain, as stated by the state Senate, "more care was given to political gain than the harm caused to a man and his family.” Renaud's experience, "hasn’t been easy." Renaud was, "politically persecuted," and was even used & abused in "attack ads" aired by his political action committee. [The full statement is well & truly worth reading. Possibly one of the most important statements a researcher has made in recent times.](goodies/josh-renaud-personal-statement.pdf) |
| 2021-10-21 | [Apple](https://apple.com/), [@apple](https://github.com/apple) | [Denis Tokarev](https://twitter.com/illusionofcha0s), [@illusionofchaos](https://github.com/illusionofchaos) | DMCA Takedowns of Mirror | iOS App Developer & Security Researcher [Denis Tokarev (illusionofchaos)](https://github.com/illusionofchaos) has developed an interesting relationship with Apple since early 2021. The researcher participated in Apple's Bug Bounty program in hope's of receiving a payout for his research having submitted the details between March 10 and May 4 of 2021. Four months later, Tokarev published his (Disclosure of four 0-day iOS vulnerabilities and his opinion of the [Apple Security Bounty Program](https://habr.com/en/post/579714/). To this day, Tokarev is still not listed on the [Apple Security Advisory for iOS 14.7 and iPadOS 14.7 security advisory.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212601). In his words, "_When I confronted them, they apologized, assured me it happened due to a processing issue and promised to list it on the security content page of the next update. There were three releases since then and they broke their promise each time._" Frustrated with the lackluster **communication** between Apple's illusive security team, Tokarev eventually published his Proofs of Concept on GitHub: ["iOS gamed exploit (fixed in 15.0.2)"](https://github.com/illusionofchaos/ios-gamed-0day), a redacted ["Analyticsd pre-14.7 exploit"](https://github.com/illusionofchaos/ios-analyticsd-pre14.7-exploit), ["nehelper enumerate installed apps 0-day (iOS 15.0)"](https://github.com/illusionofchaos/ios-nehelper-enum-apps-0day), and ["Nehelper Wifi Info 0-day (iOS 15.0)"](https://github.com/illusionofchaos/ios-nehelper-wifi-info-0day). A Jailbreak community member, [@rllbe](https://github.com/rllbe), released a [patch exclusively for Jailbroken devices named entitlementfix](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/pvaztb/free_release_entitlementfix_workaround_for_the_3/). This is great for Jailbroken phones but does not help the millions of regular iPhones which are still vulnerable to attacks, namely information disclosure. Valued at $100,000 or more on the Example/Dummy Bounty payout page, or perhaps an exponentially higher value on the grey market, Tokarev has yet to receive a bounty, nor recognition, other than an email from Apple stating that they made an error in crediting his research. Apple silently patched one of the exploits in July with the release of iOS 14.7. To add to the already difficult relationship, Tokarev discovered and mirrored a helpful website with API documentation named "Atlas" for research purposes. ["Atlas is developed and maintained by the Hardware Test Engineering (HWTE) Software Platform group."](https://web.archive.org/web/20211019101209/http://101.132.96.154/) The repository [is currently serving the DMCA takedown notice Apple sent him](https://github.com/illusionofchaos/apple-atlas-docs). What makes this takedown unique is that the fact that the original server is still live; Tokarev mirrored a documentation resource, which is very common procedure on GitHub. Along with the GitHub DMCA notice, Tokarev [had multiple tweets also taken down](https://twitter.com/illusionofcha0s/status/1450588596407259139). The DMCA content removal [takedown notices on GitHub are publicly etched into GitHub's DMCA repository](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2021/10/2021-10-18-apple.md); the [Lumen database copy can be viewed here](https://lumendatabase.org/notices/25498447). The researcher was also [locked out of his Twitter account at one point](https://twitter.com/illusionofcha0s/status/1450902601864732679/photo/1). As per DMCA submission rules on Twitter, the firm representing Apple, swears, "_under penalty of perjury,_" that the the documentation is Apple's copyright. What makes this case seem targeted is that **only** Tokarev's content has been DMCA'ed by Apple- absolutely no other reply, public tweet, or image containing the IP address has apparently been removed from Twitter. [An archive of the alleged offending content page, while still live, is archived.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211019101209/http://101.132.96.154/). On October 25, 2021, [@apple](https://github.com/apple) eventually added the contribution, in Analytics affecting iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch (7th generation). It was issued CVE-2021-30871 and the impact statement was, "A local attacker may be able to access analytics data." NIST analysts scored the bug [5.5 CVSS MEDIUM](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30871).|
| 2021-10-15 | [The State of Missouri](https://www.mo.gov/) | [St. Louis Post-Dispatch](https://www.stltoday.com/)  | State law vs. Good-faith research, alleged hacktivism. | On October 12th, the Missouri Department of Elementary & Secondary Education was made aware of a vulnerability in a portal that was leaking personal information of Missouri educators. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, [in a press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxJjLWa9R2g) stated that at least 3 educators' data was specifically accessed. It is not known whether these 3 educators' data were used to validate the vulnerability, or whether they were specifically targeted by the researcher. It was stated that it would not be possible to download all of the personal data at once. Under 2017 Statute 569.095 of Missouri Law: *"A person commits the offense of tampering with computer data if he or she knowingly and without authorization or without reasonable grounds to believe that he has such authorization: Accesses a computer, a computer system, or a computer network, and intentionally examines information about another person; a class A misdemeanor."* The Gov. stated that this may cost at least [$50 million dollars to patch](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/14/1046124278/missouri-newspaper-security-flaws-hacking-investigation-gov-mike-parson), diverting Missouri State resources for Legal costs, the Cole County Prosecutor, and Missouri State Highway Patrol Digital Forensics Unit to investigate the alleged wrongdoing. Therein lies the issue, that had this vulnerability not been reported to the vendor, it would remain to be vulnerable and the state would likely be unaware of it being exploited for malicious purposes. To complicate matters for both the researcher and the vendor (ITSD who programs & maintains the portal), it was alluded to during the press conference that the researcher was going to use the information for political gain, under the guise of research. In Missouri, it is unlawful to access "encoded" data (the passwords were allegedly base64 encoded), which may include viewing HTML source code or to compromise systems to embarrass the state and allegedly, "sell headlines," for their new outlet. Two issues that should be highlighted in this event is that is can be argued that is a Class A misdemeanor in Missouri to essentially push the F12 key while browsing a website, but the researcher has also been alleged to either be employed by or have provided the data to a local news outlet, as a "political vendetta," which could fall under bad-faith research, or hacktivism, if the data was published. Regardless, the embarrassment of a leaky portal lies with the developer of the website, [and the St. Louis Post-Dispath](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agency-s-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html), stated "The newspaper delayed publishing this report to give the department time to take steps to protect teachers’ private information, and to allow the state to ensure no other agencies’ web applications contained similar vulnerabilities." |

| 2021-07-13 | [Apple](https://apple.com/), [@apple](https://github.com/apple) | [Corellium](https://www.corellium.com/), [@corellium](https://github.com/corellium),  | Relentless dissmissed copyright infringement lawsuits of good faith research platform | [Apple](https://github.com/apple)'s [Bug Bounty rules](https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/requirements/) permits Security Researchers to, "copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, or create derivative works of such [Apple](https://github.com/apple) software," provided they share the results with [Apple](https://github.com/apple). However, in 2019, [Apple](https://github.com/apple) filed a lawsuit against Corellium, stating that it participates, "with no license or permission from [Apple](https://github.com/apple)." Moreover, "[Apple](https://github.com/apple) approved of [Corellium](https://www.corellium.com/) participating in its invitation-only Security Bounty Program (“bug bounty program”) with a promise to [pay for software bugs identified by Corellium](goodies/Corellium_10-28-2019_Case_9:19-cv-81160-RS_Document_41_Entered_on_FLSD_Docket.pdf) in court documents dated 10-28-2019." [Apple](https://github.com/apple) gladly accepted and utilized bugs submitted by Corellium as part of this program [yet] broke its promise to pay for them." Apple's bug bounty began in 2016, but was only opened to the public in 2019. This means anyone can participate. Corellium was a participant of the invitation-only program. Corellium claims it is owed $300,000 in unpaid bounties. Apple is known to change the prices, with Apple originally offering up to [$1,500,000](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12192019a) as the maximum payout, but that has since come down to $1,000,000. Moreover, an "iCloud" bounty is listed with a [maximum payout of $100,000](https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/) on the main page, however, a "limited" iCloud bypass is only a [mere $25,000](https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/payouts/). Apple has previously, ["made eBay remove a listing that offered a prototype iPhone for sale for $10,000"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xw7gx/iphone-emulation-company-sued-by-apple-says-its-making-iphones-safer). Bizarrely, Apple only offers the "Security Research Device" (SRD) for the iPhone, abandoning the iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS which do not have Research Devices. The number of vulnerabilities discovered on SRDs is extremely    low, with many vulnerabilities coming from ZDI as well as anonymous researchers. [Apple](https://github.com/apple) sued Corellium in 2019, for copyright infringement. The copyright claim is a disgrace to researchers, far and wide, and even stated 08-15-2019, ["Apple strongly supports good-faith security research on its platforms, and has never pursued legal action against a security researcher,"](goodies/Corellium_08-15-2019_Case_9:19-cv-81160-RS_Document_1_Entered_on_FLSD_Docket.pdf) yet is pursuing the only platform that empowers researchers to participate in [Apple](https://github.com/apple)'s program. [Apple](https://github.com/apple) lost that lawsuit, demonstrating a clear & apparent disconnect between the company and good faith Security Researchers. The UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA dismissed every single one of [Apple](https://github.com/apple)'s claims. The COURT ruled on 05-11-2020 ["Corellium does not infringe any of Apple's copyrights."](goodies/Corellium_05-11-2020_Case_9:19-cv-81160-RS_Document_456_Entered_on_FLSD_Docket.pdf) Apple ignored the ruling, filing another lawsuit, casting a shadow of legal uncertainty over the entire Security Research community. [Apple](https://github.com/apple) admits to trying to buy Corellium, in which Corellium was approached by Federighi, Andrews, & Krstic, who are Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, the Vice President of OS Software Engineering, and the Head of [Apple](https://github.com/apple)'s Security Engineering and Architecture, respectively. The case was "DONE AND ORDERED in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, [on] 29th day of December 2020, noting [Corellium may make fair use of iOS](goodies/Corellium_12-29-2020_Case_9:19-cv-81160-RS_Document_784_Entered_on_FLSD_Docket.pdf), but it is not absolved of potential liability for allegedly employing circumvention tools to unlawfully access iOS or elements of iOS." However, Apple's Bug Bounty program specifically permits the above, if you report the bugs to [Apple](https://github.com/apple). This series of lawsuits destroys credibility in the Security Research community, and Apple's lower-than-expected payouts deters researchers from reporting the bugs to Apple, with many researchers opting to sell their exploits elsewhere. One such example, is the clear fact is the sheer volume of submissions that come through the Zero Day Institute.

As a result of the arrest, thousands of 1-star reviews were left on the T-Systems (T-Mobile) and the BKK Facebook pages. The NFC/Smart Card system was apparently trivial to defeat for the unknown 18 year old security researcher. A number of flaws were reported, including passwords being emailed in plain text when asking for a password reminder, an IDOR allowing accessing the data of other users by manipulating the UR, the ability to clone tickets, the ability to change the price of tickets, and the admin password being "adminadmin". [Read an archive summary of the research on marai.me](https://web.archive.org/web/20200202080209/https://blog.marai.me/2017/07/24/18-year-old-arrested-bkk-tsystems-e-ticket/). After arresting the innocent security researcher, the story went viral, and resulted in T-Systems Hungary hosting a press conference 4 days later, and that the researcher had conducted an "illegal hacking attempt", yet reported the bug to the vendor. The BKK CEO told the press that they didn't receive the original report from the security researcher, because he sent it to the wrong email address, which this fact was completely debunked with a screenshot from the researcher.

Notes about this page:

-   Companies that broadly use the [DMCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) may not be included. This page focuses on companies that specifically use legal threats to stifle **security** research.
-   Many companies may use financial threats to stifle research, threatening to pull funding, support contracts or influence customers. There is an arguably fine line between legal threats (costly) and financial threats (also costly). These may be included if they can be properly documented.
-   Companies that fire off Cease & Desist (C&D) letters but do not follow-up will be included here if applicable.

The following incidents are either **not confirmed** as legal or financial threats, or are confirmed and still cross the line to some degree. They are being included here in the hopes that someone will come forward with additional information or clarification.

The vulnerabilities were disclosed after the vendor refused to provide a remediation plan. The researcher has [terminated their participatin in the vendor's consultant program](http://wejn.com/wowza/). |

Years later, Miller disclosed that Google [went after him via his employer](https://twitter.com/0xcharlie/status/581433111944175616). When asked for details, he [clarified that it was not a legal threat](https://twitter.com/0xcharlie/status/581483558608326656), but a lecture on "responsible disclosure" to his boss at the time. |

The following incidents are related to the ones above, but "cross the line". They include incidents where it was not "security research", but rather activity that was considered a crime by current laws (at the time). Instead of following a more ethical approach or going the route of responsible disclosure, the researcher chose to research and disclose the details in a manner that was questionable. While the threat of law suit of such activity is frivilous to most, the companies are being prudent because the researcher in question likely did break laws in the process.

Over the years, many talks have been cancelled for various reasons. Sometimes, the rumor of legal threats dominate the venue and/or news, but never happened. This table will list such events, to help clarify what happened. As time allows, any case of a security talk being cancelled will be added.
